The backbone of the project is baed on an idea of Colt Steele, from "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024" course, available on Udemy.
The main new features and improvements I added are the following:
- migration to MongoDB database
- new theme
- new Homepage with responsive Appbar
- authentication with local username/password and Google Id
- new navigation bar
- authorization
- ALL TODOs list available for each user
- added Priority and expring date to todos and editing functionalities
- todos sorting and filtering capabilities
- list deleting
  
## New Authentication Framework
The new release includes a new authentication interface and logic that allow user to sign up, login and logout and provides access to protected routes only for authenticated users.

Each user has an ALL TODOs list on the top of the available item lists, which allows to view the whole set of todos for the specific user.

An user can create his own list, with the possibility to assign a name and an icon:
